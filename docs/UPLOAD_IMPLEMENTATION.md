# Image and Video Upload Implementation Roadmap

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing image and video upload functionality in Postify, focusing on existing implementation points in the codebase.

## Phase 1: Basic Image Upload
### Current Implementation Status
1. Create Post Page (`app/create/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Has basic file input setup
   - ✅ Has client-side image preview
   - ❌ No server upload implementation
   - ❌ No progress indicator
   - ❌ Limited file validation

2. Edit Post Page (`app/edit/[id]/page.tsx`)
   - ✅ Has UI for image change
   - ❌ No image upload implementation
   - ❌ No image replacement functionality
   - ❌ No progress indicator

3. Post Preview (`components/post-preview.tsx`)
   - ✅ Has image display functionality
   - ❌ No direct upload integration
   - ❌ No image optimization

### Phase 1A: Frontend Enhancement
1. Improve existing image upload component in Create Post
   - Add proper drag-and-drop functionality
   - Enhance file selection dialog
   - Improve image preview with zoom/crop
   - Add comprehensive file validation
   - Implement upload progress indicator

2. Implement image upload in Edit Post
   - Reuse enhanced upload component
   - Add image replacement functionality
   - Maintain aspect ratio consistency
   - Add image edit history

3. Create shared ImageUpload component
   - Extract common functionality
   - Make it reusable across pages
   - Add error handling
   - Add loading states

### Phase 1B: Backend Implementation
1. Set up cloud storage
   - Choose and configure cloud storage provider
   - Create secure upload endpoints
   - Implement file type validation
   - Set up image optimization and resizing

2. Create API endpoints
   - POST /api/upload/image for single image upload
   - DELETE /api/upload/image/:id for image deletion
   - PUT /api/upload/image/:id for image replacement
   - GET /api/upload/image/:id for image metadata

3. Database Integration
   - Add image metadata storage
   - Track upload history
   - Handle image relationships with posts

## Phase 2: Multiple Image Upload
1. Enhance upload component
   - Add multiple file selection
   - Create image gallery preview
   - Add reordering capability
   - Implement individual progress tracking

2. Update API endpoints
   - Modify POST /api/upload/image to handle multiple files
   - Add batch operations for multiple images

## Phase 3: Video Upload Implementation
### Frontend Implementation
1. Create video upload component
   - Add video file selection
   - Implement video preview
   - Add video thumbnail generation
   - Show upload progress
   - Add video duration limits

2. Update existing components
   - Add video support to post creation
   - Add video support to post editing
   - Create video player component

### Backend Implementation
1. Set up video processing
   - Configure video transcoding service
   - Set up video format validation
   - Implement video compression
   - Create thumbnail generation service

2. Create video API endpoints
   - POST /api/upload/video for video upload
   - GET /api/upload/video/:id/status for processing status
   - DELETE /api/upload/video/:id for video deletion

## Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. Upload optimization
   - Implement chunked uploads for large files
   - Add resume upload capability
   - Implement retry mechanism for failed uploads

2. Media management
   - Create media library
   - Add search and filtering
   - Implement media reuse across posts
   - Add media analytics

3. Social media integration
   - Add platform-specific media requirements
   - Implement format conversion for different platforms
   - Add platform-specific preview

## Technical Considerations
- Maximum file sizes
- Supported formats
- Storage quotas
- Processing limits
- Security measures
- Performance optimization
- Bandwidth management

## Dependencies
- Cloud storage service
- Video processing service
- Image optimization library
- Upload management library
- Media player components

## Timeline Estimation
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks

Total estimated time: 8-12 weeks
